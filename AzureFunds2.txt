AZURE RESOURCES - components like storage, VM, networks, database, APP resources, code and anything else available to build cloud solutions
	Resource group -  container to manage and aggregate resources in a single unit
	-> Resources can exist in only one resource group
	-> Resources can exist in different regions.
	-> Resources can be moved to different resource groups.
	-> Applications can utilize multiple resource groups.
	
	Example:
	web + db, VM and storage in same group
	OR
	web + db AND VM AND Storage in three groups
	
	Azure Resource Manager
	
	Azure Portal	Azure PowerShell	AZURE CLI	REST Clients
					
					SDKs
					
		AZURE RESOURCE MANAGER
		
	Resource groups can be created in Azure with tags with project name and value name
	If you delete a resource group, you have to go through a lot of steps as checks to make sure you want to delete it, including locks
	If you enable a read-only lock, the resource group cannot be deleted
	
	
Azure Subscriptions
	Microsoft Azure Account
	|       |			|
Dev Subs  Test Subs  Production Subs

Billing Boundary: generate separate billing reports and invoice for each subs
Access Control Boundary: manage and control access to the resources that users can provision with specific subs

Workload Strategy
	-> Application level subs
	-> Mission level access subs
	-> Business type subs
	-> Geo-location subs
	
	IAM -> Identity Access Management -> access control of subs
		-> Active Directory - Azure AD
			-> User wants to access Skype, Outlook (needs user profile -> Identity)
			-> user wants to have access to subs, db, 
			-> active directory sends token to verified client
			-> client token and active directory both send token to centralized db and if they match, there is verification
			Benefits
			-> Centralized user management
			-> Trust relationship between AD and services
			-> Services manage authorization
		-> Identity	
			-> identity can be user or application
			-> used for authentication
			-> user with username pword
			-> an application with secret keys
		
	Process of authentication
	-> user sends username and password -> if information matches -> validate
	-> server will respond - accept or deny
	
	MFE - Multifactor authentication -> like a code to your phone
	
	AZURE ROLE BASED ACCESS CONTROL - AZURE RBAC
		-> Allow one user top manage a VM in a sub and another user to manage virtual networks
		-> Allow DBA group to manage SQL dbs in a subs
		-> 
		
	3 Key Components
	-> Security principle
	-> Role
		set of permissions -> built-in or custom
	-> Scope can be applied to any level
		
	-> managed identity
	
Cost management
	-> Conduct cost analysis
	-> Create a budget -> can set budget at any level (manager, subscription, dev, etc) -> budget boundary will alert management
	-> Review recommendations
	-> Export data
	
	Azure reservations -> applying savings 
	Hybrid Benefits - Use Windows Server and SQL servier on-premises licenses
	Azure Credits - montly benefits and deals
	Regions - choose low cost regions and locations
	
	Azure cost management to monitor, budget, alert and reommendation
	Autoscaling - automatically changes bases upon usage
	Azure Monitor to scale down under-utilized resources

Fault Tolerance

	Web		VM			SQL
	
	Servers				Disk Arrays

Agility - flexibility in changes in computing - fault tolerance, highly reliable, redundancy

Manual - too much beaurocracy
Cloud - can just purchase from console with mgmt approval

Fail-over - disaster recovery
	keep redundant data in another region so that data is not lost
