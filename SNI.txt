What is SNI (Server Name Indication)?

Many web servers are more like apartment buildings than houses: 
They host several domain names, and so the IP address alone is not enough to indicate which domain a user is trying to reach. 
This can result in the server showing the wrong SSL certificate, which prevents or terminates an HTTPS connection 
â€“ just like a package can't be delivered to an address if the correct person doesn't sign for it.

PROBLEM:
When multiple websites are hosted on one server and share a single IP address, 
each website has its own SSL certificate, 
so the server may not know which SSL certificate to show when a client device tries to securely connect to one of the websites. 
This is because the SSL/TLS handshake occurs before the client device indicates over HTTP which website it's connecting to.

SOLUTION:
Server Name Indication (SNI) is designed to solve this problem. 
SNI is an extension for the TLS protocol (formerly known as the SSL protocol), which is used in HTTPS. 
It's included in the TLS/SSL handshake process in order to ensure that client devices are able to see the 
correct SSL certificate for the website they are trying to reach. 

The extension makes it possible to specify the hostname, or domain name, of the website during the TLS handshake, 
instead of when the HTTP connection opens after the handshake.

SNI adds the domain name to the TLS handshake process, so that the TLS process reaches the right domain name 
and receives the correct SSL certificate, enabling the rest of the TLS handshake to proceed as normal.
