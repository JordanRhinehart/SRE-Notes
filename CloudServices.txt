CLOUD - AZURE
	THE 2ND LARGEST PUBLIC CLOUD
	THE HIGHEST GROWTH RATE
	THE MOST REGIONS
	THE MOST POPULAR IN ENTERPRISES
	
=> TO BUILD ENTERPRISE APPLICATION
	
CLOUD - Virtual Machines -> Hypervisor based virtualization 
	(Google - "Instance")
	(AWS - "EC2")

Introduction to the CLOUD
	Web Application -> Hardware, Software, Networking Component <== pre-cloud
	On demand delivery of IT resources/services via Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing
	
	USER MANAGEMENT -> ALWAYS GO WITH THE LEAST PRIVELEGED CHOICES
	
COMPANIES WHO OFFER CLOUD 
	companies who build huge data centers
	fill it with servers, networking, cooling, electricity, etc
		services: AI, IoT, Kubernetes, etc 
	design and install variations
	publicly accessed (PRIVATE WOULD BE ONLY ACCESSED AT ON-SITE SERVER)
	
If you need a server IN THE CLOUD ERA:
	Create it in the cloud within minutes
	Use it as you wish
	Pay for what you use
	Shut it down when not needed
	Automatically maintained, patched, secured, monitored -> service provider is responsible
	
5 Characteristics of Cloud Computing
	On-Demand Self Service  -> whenever you want you can use it
		-> no human interaction is needed for resource provisioning
		-> resource can be provisioned with a click of the button
		-> provisioning is available 24/7
	
	Broad Network Access -> network at a different level than private that you can use
		-> resouces can be accessed from anywhere using the network
		-> ideally high broadband
		-> no physical access is required at any time
		
	Resource Pooling ->available to you
		-> pysical resources are shared between customers -> customers have no idea who else is using the resources 
		-> the cloud's backbone decides which physical resource to allocate for a customer's virtual services
		-> Some advanced cloud services allow for physical resource separation -> governmnet might want a dedicated data center
		
	Rapid Elasticity  -> ability of the system to scale
		-> resources can be scaled up and down as needed, automatically
		-> no need to purchase resources for a one-time peak scenario
		
	Measured Service -> cost based 
		-> payment is done only for resources actually used
		-> server time / DB storage / Function calls etc
		-> measurement usually done in high-resolution
			->server time by the second
		-> no need to invest money in non-used resources 
		
	CapEx - traditional IT	OpEx
	Capital Expense			Operating Expense
	upfront investment		Pay for operation
	for future use/profit
	
	build data center		Electricity
	purchase server			Salaries
	purchase A/C			Maintenance
	purchase software
	purchase licenses
	hire staff
	
	Cloud OpEx -> if properly configured and used
	Extremely flexible
	Optimal utilization
	
	5 Major Components Associated with a Cloud Server:
		1. cpu -> 4 vcpu
		2. RAM -> 16 GB ram
		3. storage -> hard disk -> 32 GB
		4. OS -> Linux -> image
		5. network -> nic
	
	Cloud Service Types
	1. IaaS - infrastructure as a service -> VMs
		-> networking, storage, servers, virtualization all managed by service
			cloud provides the host machine, networking and disks
		-> OS, middleware, runtime, data, applications run by you
		
		CON: level of control is a consideration for a developer -> only want to be responsible for data and applications
	
	2. PaaS - Platform as a service -> Web Apps
		-> networking, storiage, servers, virtualization, OS, midlewar, runtime managed by service
		-> data, applications are your responsibility
		-> the cloud provides the runtime for running web apps
			-> you, the client, upload the code, and it just runs
			-> you, the client, have no access to the underlying virtual machines
		-> serverless possibility
		
		CON: less control, higher cost 
	
	3. SaaS - Software as a service - completely managed by the service -> no control
		-> Google
		-> Zoom
		-> Office 365
		
		CON: no control, high cost
	
	4. AIaaS - AI as a service 
	5. DBaaS - database as a service
	6. DaaS - Desktop as a service
	7. IoTaaS - Internet of Things as a Service
	
TYPES OF CLOUDS
	1. Public -> all resources/services public -> isolated by cloud service - e-commerce clients -> clients have no access to underlying infrastructure
	
	2. Private -> all dedicated to one company -> healthcare, u.s. govt -> accessible only in the organization's network -> subset of cloud resourses
	
	3. Hybrid -> somee private, some public -> banking would be private, marketing would be public -> workloads separated between the two clouds
		data segregation: sensitive data in the organization's premises, public data in the public cloud
		
	4. Multi-cloud -> Azure and AWS
		
	Delivery is the way the services are being delivered to the customer; deployment is the way these resources are being depoloyed.
