SECURITY
	How to secure the application
	VM SECURITY
		Vnet -> Bastion Host -> disassociate public IP
		Limit the processes and time on VM -> modify permissions
		Restrict access to the VM as much as possible
		Make sure only the required ports are open (22/1389/443/80)
		Limit access to specific IP addresses when possible
		Prefer using Bastion for accessing the VM so no need for open ports
		If the VM is not public facing- place it in a VNet that's not connected to the internet -> private IP only
		
	Network Security
		-> Subnets -> Network Security Groups are applied on the subnet level
		-> Vnet that contains private resouces only should not be exposed to the internet
		-> Always use nsg to restrict access to subnets
		-> Use Service Endpoints / Private Endpoints
		
	Azure Security Center
		-> Microsoft Defender for Cloud
		-> A central location for monitoring and alerting security related issues
		-> Displays a summarized list of problems found in the subs resources
		-> In some cases, allow a single click fix
