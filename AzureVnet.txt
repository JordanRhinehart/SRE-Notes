3-Tier Architecture

	1, Web servers
	2. Application servers
	3. DB servers 
	
	Vnet needs subnets
		user -> web server -> application server -> db server
		user <- web server <- application server <- db server
		
	Characteristics of VNet 	
	scoped to a single region
	cannot span across multiple regions
	scoped for a single subnets
	
	Internet to Application
	
	two separate vnets
	
	
Steps:	
	-> Create resourceGroup 
	-> Create Vnet -> add subnet backend
	-> Create load balancer with inbound/outbound rules + health probe rules + frontend ip configuration + backendppool
	-> Create VM using HTTP/SSH -> download SSH key
	-> Connect VM to Vnet -> open git bash 
	-> run the command:
	ssh -i Downloads/mylbVM_key.pem <azureuser@40.69.171.222> <==public IP Address listed on connect page
	
	run the following commands to connect:
	sudo apt-get update - gets all the updates
	sudo apt-get update -y
	sudo apt-get install apache2 -y
	sudo systemctl status apache2
	
	To disassociate IP address from VM, go to mylbVM-ip click on disassociate
	The public IP address will not show anymore

	To use Load Balancer we have to autoscale the vnet and VMs
	Use Virtual Machine Scale Set
	
	ssh -i Downloads/my_key.pem
