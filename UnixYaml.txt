Netplan - uses YAML (yet another markup language)

/etc/netplan/.

test the configuration and revert back:
	netplan try
	
to directly apply:
	netplan apply
	
network:
	version: 2
	renderer: networkd (one of the possible options)
	ethernets:
		eth0:
			dhcp4: yes (IPv4)

network:
	version: 2
	renderer: NetworkManager (do not have to list machines: all network interfaces will have a dynamic IP assigned by it)
	
network:
	version: 2
	renderer: NetworkManager
	ethernets:
		eth0:
			dhcp4: no (IPv4)
			addresses: [192.168.1.50/24]
			gateway4: 192.168.1.1 
			nameservers:
				search: [local]
				addresses: [192.168.1.1,  8.8.8.8]
		eth1: ...same
		
Network Scripts:		
	It's possible to list multiple network interfaces with the ethernets in one single YAML file
	It is also possible to have multiple YAML files - in this case, they will be processed sequentially as per numbers in their nameservers
		01-netcfg.yaml
		02-netcfg-test.yaml
	In case of multiple YAML files, they will all be processed; it is impossible to exclude some processing if they exist in the directory

Check the status:
	ifconfig
