CRONTAB - Script Scheduler

	Allows to schedule and periodically run any of the executable process or script
	Somehow is equivalent to Windows Task Scheduler
	The minimal granularity of the scheduling: every minute (most infrequent = yearly)
	
	PROS:
	Very powerful mechanism present in all Unix/Linus and MacOS
	Scheduling can be scripted or otherwise automated itself
	There is a possibility to define separate schedules for every user on the server
	
	CONS:
	Need to know syntax
	Any schedule would be periodic; it is impossible by default to schedule a one-time run
	The default granularity is once every minute - cannot run every second
	
	zone goes
	min (0-59) -> hour (0-23) -> day of month (1-31) -> month (1-12 or jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun...) -> day of the week (0-6 where Sunday is 0)
	* => any value
	
	15 7 * * * /programs/script.ksh - runs every day at 7:15 am
	
	0 2 1 * * /scripts/backup.ksh -> runs first day of every month at 2 am
	
	28 19 28 1 * run every year on Jan 28 at 7:28 pm
	
	* * * * * -> run every minute
	
	crontab -u serguei -l -> lists serguei's schedule 
	
	crontab -e will create a temporary file which is used to type in the script as above
	
	when you type ls -l 
	
	root can edit on cron/var/
	
 	/etc/cron.allow -> anyone not in this file will not be allowed to use crontab -> whitelist
	/etc/cron.deny -> anyone in this file will not be allowed to use -> blacklist
	
	if a user is NOT in both -> default is blacklist 
	if user is in both -> user can use 
	if cron.deny exists but no cron.allow -> everyone else can use
