What does a software require?

Project management tools - Jira - Kanban
	Track the work
	
Source Code Management - Azure Repost - AWS Commit
	
CI & CD - Jenkins

Source Code Management
	purpose - version control
		a system that keeps records of your changes
		allows for collaborative development
		allows you to know who made what changes and when
		allows you to revert any changes and go back to a previous state

		
	GIT - Distributed Version Control System
		All changes done to a repository are saved by GIT
		Has its own file structure under the hood
		Historical hash to content key is saved for each snapshow 
		Can be used locally without internet connection
		
		Centralized - Remote repo - developers merge code - commit
			If repository goes down or you lose local - always have to be connected to internet
			Bad if centralized repo is lost
				
		Distributed - Must not have internet access to remote repo
			Git -> commit -> local repository
			To share -> push
			Distributed copies, have redundancy
			
		Local
			Working directory - git add - command for repository
			
			Staging Area - git commit -> local repo
			
			Local Repo - git push -> remote repo
			
		Remote Repo - Production Line - Main/Master branch
			Pull
			
			mkdir - name it make directory
			cd <<name>>
			git init - creates working directory
			ls -la - list 
			ls -la .git - all directories in git repo
			ls -l
			
						
			git config --list --global
			git config --list --system
			git config --list --local

			git add <filename> create a file 
			git add . (all files)
			git commit -m "commit message"
			
			To get into editor press i
			to get in to the insert mode: press I
			to exit: press esc , shift +:wq
			
			git status - shows files
			
			git rm - deletes file
		
		SHOW DIFF in BRANCHES
			git diff <filename> - shows different versions
		
		VIEW ALL PROGRESS
			git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
			git log --stat --summary
			git log -p
			git log --oneline
			
			gitk - opens new GUI that show all
			
			git restore --staged <filename>
		
		STASH		
			git stash - saves WIP on feature
			git stash list - show you what is stashed
			git stash apply stash@[0] 
			git stash pop[1] - takes it out of the stash
			
			git stash list - shows you the stash
			git stash pop stash@{0}
			
			git stash clear = will clear all your stashes
			git stash drop stash(1)
			
			git stash show stash@{1}
			
			git stash -u unflagged files (not previously committed)
			git stash -a stash everything
			
		If customer is using a version, create a branch for the development and for the bug to work on new features.
		Once devlopment is commited to branch -> merge into production line (main branch)
		Pull request - ask to review -> must have multiple reviewers (at least 2) ->
			has issues -> reject
			needs work -> comment
			good -> approve
		-> merge to main 
		
		when particular branch only one feature is approved, delete the branch
		when particular branch is needed for more, then keep it
		
		If users report a bug, create a new branch called "app-bug"
		
			git branch branch-name creating a branch
			git switch branch-name - switching to branch
			git branch -d - deletes branch
			git merge branch-name - merges branch into main
			git checkout -b new-branch - creates a new branch and switches to new branch


MERGING TYPES - see commands above
	Fast forward merge: In fast-forward merge, git simply moves the source branch pointer to the target branch pointer without creating an extra merge commit.
	
	Three-way merge: This is a common scenario for large features or when several developers are working on a project simultaneously. 
		If the two branches you're trying to merge both changed the same part of the same file, Git won't be able to figure out which version to use. 
		When such a situation occurs, it stops right before the merge commit so that you can resolve the conflicts manually.  
		will see >>>>> and =========== and the text or code that is conflicting - will have to manually edit
