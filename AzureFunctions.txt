Azure Functions
	Serverless - event-driven architecture (EDA)
	Reactive
	Event is triggered -> Azure function -> an event-driven code will run
	
	
Where do we use this?	
	Google Drive
	1. upload media -> triggers an event -> code -> antivirus scanning -> validation of data -> store it in the underlyging system
	2. upload media -> trigger an event -> compress the media file
	
	If you do this on VM/app service, it always has to be running
	Serverless only activates during an event trigger -> only charged for event time
	
	==> No control over the underlying system and services
	
	Analytics
	uploaded a file -> trigger an event -> do analytics -> store device -> data -> trigger code to present another data choice or refine data into UI/UX
	
	Web App
	Request for the app -> trigger an event -> code will execute -> trigger other events
